# Weather
A sample application built to learn new technologies and practice good design principles. 

# Built With
[Butter Knife](http://jakewharton.github.io/butterknife/) - Field and Method Binding

[Dagger 2](https://github.com/google/dagger) - Dependency Injection

[Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) - Java serialization/deserialization

[Retrofit](http://square.github.io/retrofit/) - Android HTTP Client

# Note
This repo is sort of a playground that I'm using to learn new technologies. As such, any given branch may have bugs, lack fully flushed-out user interfaces, etc. It's more of a learning space than a fully-developed project ðŸ“š
